    <string name="text_about">This app is meant to let climbers record the climbs that they have done.  I am hoping to add an API of local outdoor routes, and possible a way for local gyms to allow visitors to quickly record set routes, maybe by using a QR code.  Also I'd like to integrate YouTube recording is possible. </string>
