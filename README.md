# My Climbing App

###Epicodus Android Project

#### By _**Kyle Tenzeldam**_


## Description
This app's  intended use is to record climbing routes and add them to a user's profile where they can be shared with other users.

## Setup/Installation Requirements

Clone repository at https://github.com/ktenzel/MyClimbingApp.git
Open in Android Studio 3.0.1 (can be downloaded at this link: https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html)
Run MainActivity.Java
Set up Emulator (I user Nexus 6 with API 23 Marshmallow)
*The Emulator can be resource intensive and can take up to 5ghs of space on your machine and 2ghs of ram.

## Known Bugs
app duplicated itself in the Emulator at one point.

## Future additions
I want to update the navigation to a side menu or a navigation bar on the bottom. I still need to set up user profiles and have routes save to those profiles. I'd like to add YouTube, Instagram interactions with the app.

## Technologies Used

JAVA, Android Studio, XML
